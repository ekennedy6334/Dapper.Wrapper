### Dapper.Wrapper
---

This library implements the [Query Object Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html) for [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper). My first exposure to this pattern from a talk given by [Tim Rayburn](https://github.com/trayburn) on [Highway.Data](https://github.com/HighwayFramework/Highway.Data). Since then it's been used with EF, Mongo and here with [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) based on their implementation. Credit goes to him.
